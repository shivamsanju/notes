# ðŸš€ Graphs

- A graph is a collection of nodes (called vertices) and edges that connect pairs of vertices.
- Can represent many real-world structures like networks, social connections, and paths.
- **Directed Graph (Digraph)**: Edges have direction (A â†’ B means A is connected to B but not vice versa).
- **Undirected Graph**: Edges do not have direction (A â†” B means A and B are mutually connected).
- **Weighted Graph**: Edges have weights/costs (e.g., distances, costs, etc.).
- **Unweighted Graph**: Edges have no weights.

### Graph Representation

1. **Adjacency Matrix**:
	- A 2D matrix of size `V x V` (where V is the number of vertices).
	- Matrix[i][j] represents if there is an edge from vertex `i` to vertex `j` (1 or true if connected, 0 or false otherwise).
2. **Adjacency List**:
	- An array of lists. Each index represents a vertex, and each list contains all adjacent vertices.
	- More space-efficient than an adjacency matrix for sparse graphs.

    A[Vertex A]
    B[Vertex B]
    C[Vertex C]
    D[Vertex D]

    A -- 5 --> B
    A -- 3 --> C
    B -- 4 --> D
    C -- 1 --> D
```


## ðŸš€ Key Graph Operations


### Add Vertex

- Add a new node to the graph.
- For adjacency matrix, resize the matrix.
- For adjacency list, add a new list entry.

### Add Edge

- Connect two nodes by adding an edge between them.
- In an adjacency matrix, set `matrix[i][j] = 1`.
- In an adjacency list, add the destination node to the list of the source node.

### Depth First Search (DFS)

- Start at a node, visit all its neighbors before backtracking.
- Uses a stack (or recursive call stack).
- Time complexity: `O(V + E)` where V is vertices and E is edges.

### Breadth First Search (BFS)

- Start at a node and visit all its neighbors before visiting the neighborsâ€™ neighbors.
- Uses a queue.
- Time complexity: `O(V + E)`.

    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Graph graph = new Graph(5);

        // Add edges

        // Print graph
        System.out.println("Graph:");
        graph.printGraph();

        // Perform DFS
        System.out.println("\\nDFS starting from vertex 0:");
        graph.DFS(0);

        System.out.println("\\n\\nBFS starting from vertex 0:");

```


### Time Complexity

- **DFS/BFS**: `O(V + E)` where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

### Space Complexity

- **Adjacency List**: `O(V + E)`
