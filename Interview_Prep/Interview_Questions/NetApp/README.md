- What is HashMap and how it works internally
- How is collision handled in HashMap
- Given an array of elements of length `N`, ranging from `0` to `N â€“ 1`. All elements may not be present in the array. If the element is not present, then there will be `-1` present in the array. Rearrange the array such that `A[i] = i` and if `i` is not present, display `-1` at that place.
- Preorder traversal of a tree
- Mirror a binary tree
